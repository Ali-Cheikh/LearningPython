### 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.

### 2. Setting Up Python Environment

#### Installation

- Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) to download the latest version of Python.
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

- PyCharm: A powerful IDE developed by JetBrains.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight, open-source editor with Python support.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive web-based tool for data science and machine learning.
- Thonny: An IDE mede for python beginners used mostly in schools offers great set of plugins and assistance while writing code.

#### Code Editors

- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Notepad++

### 3. Basic Syntax and Data Types

#### Syntax

Python uses indentation to define code blocks, unlike other programming languages that use braces `{}`. Here's an example of Python syntax:

```python
# Hello World program
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Data Types

Python supports various data types, including:

- Integers: `int`
- Floating-point numbers: `float`
- Strings: `str`
- Lists: `list`
- Tuples: `tuple`
- Dictionaries: `dict`
- Sets: `set`

Here are examples of defining variables with different data types:

```python
# Integer
num1 = 10

# Floating-point number
num2 = 3.14

# String
name = "John Doe"

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
